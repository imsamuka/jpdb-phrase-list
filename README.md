# jpdb-phrase-list

Uses [jpdb.io](https://jpdb.io/) API to show a list of phrases you should (or could) be able to read.
Made using [AlpineJS](https://alpinejs.dev/) and [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/).

## How to use

Open `index.html` on your browser or [host it](https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-d&q=how+to+host+a+html+file) somewhere for you.

The page has a lot of caching going on, so if you gather some sentences,
you still can read and do basically everything without internet.
What you really need internet is to load the page, to use the JPDB
API to gather the sentences, and to listen audio.
